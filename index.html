        <h2>Changing Climate, More </h2>
        <h2>Damaging Weather</h2>
        <p class="para">
            The weather varies, but climate change affects the frequencies with which particular weather occurs,
            including the frequencies of extreme weather, such as heavy storms, heat waves, and droughts. More frequent
            weather extremes will underlie the most serious physical and economic effects of climate change. Prudent
            programs to adapt to current and future climate change must take these changing probabilities into account
            when making risk assessments and devising adaptation measures.
